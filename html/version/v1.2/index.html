      <p class="lead pabout">Hey everyone! I'm HerbFarmer, and this is my spot on the web where I'm diving into the world of IT. Whether it's figuring out how servers work or starting with some basic coding, I'm all about learning as I go.

      This site isn't just about showing off what I know; it's also a place where I share what I'm learning along the way. One of my main projects right now is this website you're on, where I'm tinkering with the basics of web development. But I've got some other goals in mind too, like building a webshop from scratch using JavaScript. It's all pretty new to me, but I'm excited to see where it takes me!
        
      So if you're curious about my journey into the tech world, stick around, check out what I've been working on, and let's learn together! Looking forward to sharing more with you all soon!</p>

          <p class="lead">So, I had this idea to dive into my own system and see where it's vulnerable. It's like a challenge I set for myself &#45; to break into my own digital fortress and see what needs fixing. By playing both attacker and defender, I get a real feel for where the weak spots are and how to shore them up.</p>
          <p class="lead">And the best part? It's not just about making my system safer. It's also about showcasing my skills. I can use this project as a badge of honor, something to show off on my resume or in interviews. Saying, "Hey, I hacked my own system to make it stronger" is a pretty powerful statement. It's like having a secret weapon in my back pocket when it comes to impressing potential employers or clients.</p>

          <p class="lead">But here's the kicker: it's not just about building my own shop. I'm also thinking about branching out and helping out friends and small businesses. I mean, imagine being the go-to guy for hosting websites and online shops! It's like being the neighborhood tech guru, except with a bit more flair.</p>

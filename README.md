# FirstWebsite
--------------
Welcome to my very first website project! 🚀 I’m excited to finally share it with the world. Feel free to use it as inspiration or a starting point for building your own awesome site. I hope it helps kickstart your web development journey!


Project Details
---------------
I kept all the files in the html folder because I had some issues displaying a demo using VS Code’s Live Server. Everything was built using VS Code, with a lot of help from tutorials and articles I found along the way.


A Note From Me
--------------
I know it’s not much, and it might seem basic to some, but I’m proud of it as my first published project. Maybe it’ll even inspire you to create your own cool website! 😊


New Version
-----------
Check out the new version of my website that I’ve been working on for a while. Many components are inspired by this original project:
